      not trying to hide my source. At the very least the comments
      are here for educational purposes, but mainly all this was
      done because I'm lazy and didn't want to tab between multiple
      source files. So the JS was lazily left here. Deal with it.

         The target users have slow internet so it's necessary to
         download/cache the audio files first instead of having the
         clients press play and wait 30 seconds, possibly minutes, for
         the audio to download in the background before it plays.

         This script downloads the resource from the server to the
         clients machine and loads it from the clients machine before
         the client presses the play button.

         This approach was chosen since service workers are still
         a little too new for production environments, and I don't
         like application cache which is all but removed from
         modern browsers.
